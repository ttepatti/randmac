randmac
=======

randmac is a random MAC address switcher. Make it run each time you boot your computer to give you extra security and privacy when connecting to networks. MAC Addresses are a usually-overlooked aspect of being tracked and your personal security.

Not to mention, you can be blocked on some APs (Access Points, aka wireless networks) by MAC, so this is a way to circumvent that.

This program requires macchanger and aircrack-ng to work! (It was made for people running BT or Kali flavors, so if you're running one of those then you're fine)

macchanger can be installed with "apt-get install macchanger" on Debian-based distros, or from here:

https://github.com/alobbs/macchanger

aircrack-ng can be installed with "apt-get install aircrack-ng" on Debian-based distros, or from here:

http://www.aircrack-ng.org/

In the age of being nothing more than a statistic and something to be tracked, we need to take back every shred of privacy we can get.
